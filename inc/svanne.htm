<h2>Svanne: <br>Breaking From Gregorian Monotony</h2>
<p>
Svanne is an alphabetic date format. The Svannic calendar has 26 months each consisting of 2 weeks of 7 days each. Each month's name corresponds to one of the 26 letters of the alphabet.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this special calendar is to record daily or weekly activity logs starting at year 0 when the tracking started. For example, if a blog was initiated in 2006 (which becomes its year 0), the arvelie date 13A05 is equivalent to January 6th of the 14th year after blog inception (2020).
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>01D07</code> &mdash; 2007-02-18</li>
<li><code>02A00</code> &mdash; 2008-01-01</li>
<li><code>03+00</code> &mdash; 2009-12-31</li>
</ul>
<p>
The 365th day of the year is the <i>Year Day</i>(+00), followed by the <i>Leap Day</i>(+01) on leap years.
</p>
<p>
To calculate the day of the year, convert the month's letter to a value, starting with 0 for A, multiply by 14 and add the day of the month. For example, <code>J05</code> is equal to <code>(+ 5 (* 9 14))</code>, or 131.
</p>
<p>
I wrote a quick Python script to calculate any Svannic date of the user's choosing. As a brief aside, I wrote the script entirely on a flight from PHL to SFO. It took about 2 hours and I was enthralled by the experience. Having no internet connection I was forced to rely on deeply buried programming knowledge and a mental map of how I wanted the script to operate. Typically I would employ the help of decades old forum posts or some AI assistant to fill in my knowledge gaps and speed along the writing process. As a result I feel particullarly connected and proud of this project as it constitutes not only an interesting idea (ripped selfishly and without shame from Devine Lu Linvega) but it also represents a personal triumph of relying entirely on my own skills and ingenuity. Please, clone this project and either use it or tweak it or break it. Have fun!
