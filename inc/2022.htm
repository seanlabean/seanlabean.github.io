<p><code title="November 30th">00X11</code> &mdash; Merged entire site into my <a href="https://seanlabean.github.io" target="_out">main website</a>. Added "back" button to <a href="home.html">home</a>.<q>The s'more: the most offensive assault on the human palette ever contrived.</q></p>
<p><code title="November 17th">00W12</code> &mdash; Added <a href="meta-meta.html">meta</a> page for site functionality. Added custom <a href="../404.html">404 link</a>. Added twitter feed to my <a href="journal.html">journal</a>.<q>Oh, and I guess that I just don't know.</q></p>
<p><code title="November 3rd">00V12</code> &mdash; Added old blog posts ML-Basics and Coding Bootcamp to <a href="compsci.html">compsci</a>. This constitutes the complete conversion of my old website blogs into this new space.<q>Breakfast in Los Angeles, macrobiotic stuff.</q></p>
<p><code title="October 25th">00V03</code> &mdash; Cleaned up <a href="compsci.html">compsci</a> and began <a href="diylisp.html">Sartoris</a>, a new passion project in which I build my own LISP. <q>I have found my God, meatless and senseless.</q></p>
<p><code title="October 11th">00U03</code> &mdash; Removed substructure in <a href="future.html">future</a> and <a href="histroy.html">history</a>. <q>Roswell was actually a Russian psyop to sow turmoil in the American mind. I'm literally insane.</q></p>

Added <a href="europe.html">europe pics</a> and <a href="media.html">photography journal</a> which needs to be refined. Why have it under <a href="journal.html">journal</a> and also have an unpopulated <a href="art.html">art page</a> under <a href="hobbies.html">hobbies</a>? <q>God is change.</q></p>
