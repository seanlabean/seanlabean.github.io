        Hard to believe a year ago I had no idea I would be packing my things and leaving Philly for the small-town Indiana life. I had not yet been to China, hadn't quit my job. A lot can happen in a year. Much as happened so far in the 4th year of the wiki, though the stand-out moments are starting my new job as a Director of Engineering and running a 10 mile trail race.

        My job is, so far, quite fun. I have a sense I am simultaneously out of my depth and fully capable of making some rapid important change in the company. I wont talk much details here still as I think it does a diservice to myself and to report on only the first steps of a grand adventure. That said, I am happy to be there, I think it was the right move, and I'm looking forward to what's in store.

        The trail race was the 10 mile fun-run of the <b>Fro</b>zen <b>Mo</b>rgan <b>Mo</b>nroe <b>Fo</b>rest (FroMoMoFo). I felt particularly underprepared for this race, I had not broken 7 miles on road for a year and a half leading up to this and nothing more than 5 miles on trail. Trail races are more difficult than road races because of the rolling hills giving significant elevation gain. So the FroMoMoFo fun-run ends up being 10 miles and climbing a 150 story building. I was sore after this one. Both my quads were busted for 3 days. I was able to get my Monday and Wednesday run in (the race was on Sunday), shuffling along, heavy legs. One of my favorite things about these hard races is watching my body build itself back. It's somehow able to pull itself from the edge of ruin and, a week later, I'm back to normal.
