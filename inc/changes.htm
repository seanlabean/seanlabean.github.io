03P Notes: Bloomington move; Bloomington

<h3>03O</h3>
<article>
    <p>We're starting to ramp up our packing efforts in preparation for the big move from Philly to Bloomington. It doesn't quite feel real yet, and I don't think I've fully accepted the impending toll that a 12 hour drive will take on my body and mind. But we'll make it.</p>
    <p>I had another burst of inspiration in and around my <a href="vindauga.html">Vindauga</a> project. In the last episode, I figured out how to render text to the screen and paired it as a caption to a series of photo album images. I realized, though, that I could also have whole pages of text rendered alongside an image, like a picture book or a series of poem-image pairs. I took this opportunity to write some code to dynamically load the text data from an external file, that way I can change elements of text without having to recompile the executable over and over. I'm really liking Vindauga and the variants it has morphed into, but I think it's about time I sat down and actually created a finished product with one of these things!</p>

    <p>Took a long train ride from Philly up to Beacon, NY. Amtrak to Moynihan Station, walk 30 minutes past Bryant Park and Times Square to Grand Central, Hudson line to Beacon. This was probably the last time I will be walking though Manhattan in a long while, and that makes me a bit sad. There truly is no other place quite like Manhattan on a Thursday evening in Summer. Rolling my go-bag over the gum-stained sidewalks, weaving through hustling business people and oblivious tourists, I felt simultaneously overwhelmed, safe, and ecstatic. Eventually, after 7 hours of travel, I made it to Beacon at 11pm at night where Ashley picked me up. After a final 1 hour drive through the pitch black stretches of highway through Wonder Lake state park and the NY CT border.</p>
    <p>We spent the 4th of July at Ashley's parents' place in New Milford.  They hosted a party with a dozen or so attendees from their church. All the older party goers spoke Mandarin primarily, which gave me a chance to test how much I've learned so far (and gave me a powerful flashback to being back in China). My Mardarin vocabulary failed me nearly completely, but I was able to pick up on a few things like "son" or "watermelon" that allowed me to understand the context of the conversation.</p>
    <p><b><code>03N03</code></b> - This was a long time coming. After two months of designing and creating a ring, two weeks of planning with Ashley's siblings, and seven years of dating, I proposed to Ashley in a field of wild wheat in the western hills of Conneticut. And she said yes!</p>

        A major heatwave grips the city once again. Unbelieveable temperatures. The move to Indiana is being finalized and my remote work situation is for the most part secured.

        I am leaning fully into learning Mandarin now. Seven years to go for fluency. I wrote my first <a href="mandarin.html">iOS app</a>, allowing me to store hanzi flashcards as csv data which I can then load into the app and view as simple flashcards. I can rate the cards with a difficulty level and weight their visibility based on this weight.

        We are starting to give away things in preparation for the move.

    We traveled to Asia. Two weeks abroad exploring and visiting family in Taiwan and China. This was an incredible and demanding experience that I will remember forever. I have a lot of work ahead of me to curate my photography and make a Vindauga zine and blog post. The most lasting effects of this trip will certainly be my resolution to learn Mandarin. I want to be professionally fluent in 7 years. I also refactored Vindauga to act as a simple digital photo album to cycle through my trip pictures. I think once I add the functionality to load in all images in a folder rather than hard-coding them I should publish it as a separate program. It works surprisingly well and the act of loading all images into a buffer at startup means there is no load time when clicking between images which is convenient.

        <li>Taipei City, Taiwan</li>
        <li>Beijing, China</li>

    One of the benefits of having 12-hour jet lag is the temporary ability to make use of early morning hours. After waking fully rested at 4:30am, we made our way out to the John Heinz wildlife sanctuary where I took pictures of tree and barn swallows, great and great blue herons, and other birds. I submitted a picture of a tree swallow to a local photo competition.

    <p><a href="vindauga.html">Vindauga</a> has come a long way and I am pleased to report that it has reached a final draft of sorts. I imagine I will be adding many features to it and refactoring some of the clutter for many months to come but the core functionality is there. A few of the final core components were: scene memory - the ability to navigate backards through previously visited scenes, music, text rendering, clickable visualization with debug switch. I was also able to find a memory leak which was causing the footprint to grow linearly with time. One of the first enhancements I intend to make is to dynamically load the scene images only when they are navigated to, at the moment all images are loaded once at the start of the program. 
    </p>
    <p>Otherwise we are scambling to prepare for our major adventure of the year: a 2-week trip to Taiwan and China! Very excited for this.</p>

    <p>I've been working hard on my point-and-click SDL2 game. So far so good! It's been incredibly rewarding to meet weekly with the boys, it has been keeping my progress steady. And it's also cool to see what other people are working on and how they flex their skills to make something interesting. I comfortably created a little scene where clicking on a region displays a new image, right clicking returns you to the starting image, all while some atmospheric music plays in the background. I hit a couple snags trying to flesh the system out into something fully extensible, I am currently trying to figure out a way to track what image the player is currently looking at and what they were previously looking at so that right-clicking takes you back to that image, not just to the starting image. The boys had a good suggestion of using a tree structure of some sort. I am calling the game vindauga, old-norse for "wind's eye", which was subsumed into the English language as "window". I've been keeping a log of all my developments, using my forth-based HTML parser <a href="myrr.html">myrr</a>. You can read the blog <a href="vindauga.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm trying to get back into running again. Leaping headlong into high mileage is not the move, though. I am quick to injury with my damned right leg. I expect I am going to eventually require surgery or targeted steroid injections of some kind.</p>
    <p>As part of my weekly meetings with my coding crew I am getting back into programming in C. I'm a bit burnt out on following a tutorial line by line though I am very pleased by how much I've learned in this manner. I've been making a lot of 1bit drawings lately and figured this would be a good opportunity to make a game using those. I don't know the first thing about sprite sheets or game assets and certainly nothing about 3d assets. But, I can make decent 2d black and white art. Maybe I'll make a point and click adventure of some kind.</p>

    <p>Down and down.</p>
    <p>I developed a passing interest in the Forth programming language. Fascinating construction and a very different way of thinking about computation. I followed some guides and wrote a text-parsing program which takes a custom Markdown-like file (I call it Myrrtext) and makes the text HTML compliant. The program is built to recognize special characters within the Myrrtext and jumps to and executes special Forth functions (a.k.a. words) which modify the text or insert HTML element markers. In this sense, the Myrrtext itself is self-modifying.</p>
    <p>We saw the peak of the Philadelphia cherry blossoms on a cold misty day. Brought my camera, but no great picture opportunities. Still, it was a fun outing with friends.</p>
    <p>I've started meeting weekly with a group of friends to talk about our own programming projects as a way to stay motivated and accountable.</p>

        We went to Puerto Rico! We rented a car in San Juan from a highly questionable rental car company, which ended up being completely fine, and drove two and a half hours to the south western corner of the island. Guanica national forest. We relaxed at a beautiful beach resort and prepped for our purpose for being there: a wedding! And better yet, I was a groomsman! Such an honor and what a wonderful place to celebrate. Made some new friends too. Overall it was a very successful bout of travel, I'm proud of us for that.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started working through a tutorial of making several video games in C. I intend to lear the language this way. I am at first resistant to the fact that I am basically resigned to copying the tutorial line by line, but I figure might as well develop the muscle memory of the language and hope I pick up some syntax quirks along the way. No need to make this hard.

        Though I hate talking about politics here as it generally makes me angry and sad, I think it's important to note that I believe this jaunt marks the beginnings of a true constitutional crisis. The only thing I feel I have the power to do right now is be aware and live my life to the fullest in spite of the disaster around me.

        I consolidated all of my graphical and textual art programs into a my sonoshee project space. I was pleasantly surprised at the volume of genuinely cool pieces of generative art I've developed over the years.

        Back to the Pw/S project, I want to revitalize my introductory physics knowledge in case I'll need it again soon (more on that later).

        More 1 bit drawings! I've mostly finished my fantasy world map and made two other drawings of some of the underground cities. It's fun posting these on Mastodon and Bsky. I like having these small communities of real (see: non-bot) people who I don't know in real life and yet still seem to like my creations. I even had someone say they liked my art style. I didn't even know I had a style. I didn't know I could <em>ever</em> have a style.

        I've hit 50 subscribers on <a href="pws.html">Pw/S</a>! I've been streaming my Skyrim playthrough. Still no consistent viewers, but someone seems to like my stuff!

        Went to a Flyers game in an ice storm for my friend's bachelor party. It was fun! And I cant wait for his wedding. The Eagles won the Superbowl the next day.

        I've continued toying with an idea for a fantasy world. A society many thousands of years in the future, all underground thriving in the caverns and rifts. I'm working some elements of magic in, but I like thinking about the political implications of the world. I don't have a driving hook yet but I'm going to stick with this and just assume something comes along eventually.

        I started and completed the game Outer Wilds. The game was quite fun. I was tripped up a couple times though because of a constant habit of overthinking things. Since I knew absolutely nothing about the game going into it, I had no clue how complicated or not the puzzles were. No spoilers here, but if you want to watch me play through the whole thing, I've livestreamed everything on <a href="pws.html">Pw/S</a>.

        I took apart my trusty laptop and replaced its CMOS battery! A painfully simple operation but just enough to get me used to staring into my computer's guts.

        A slow and sicky start to the year. Not a whole lot going on yet but I am excited to reset my priorities and start the year off with some intention. I've started using a wider array of the 100r/Varvara ecosystem, specifically Noodle for 1-bit drawings. I find it quite relaxing to draw something simple and am amazed at the level of artistry that exists in the 1-bit space. Some absolutely incredible pieces are out there in addition to seemingly endless possibilities for simple characters and icons. I can't wait to keep exploring. I've started making a map of an imaginary world as well which has been a lot of fun. I'll share it here on the wiki once I have some backstories written up.

        Otherwise, I have been forcing myself to engage in the somewhat intimidating world of Linux. Installing packages and such is easy enough, but I recently had to do something that would have paralyzed me a few years ago: installing printer drivers. I didn't know what a driver was, why it was important, or what to do with it. Why can't I just plug a printer in and just print something?? I'm proud of myself though, I did the research and figured it out, and now I look back at my confused self and feel great knowing it was so easy to break out of that paralysis.
