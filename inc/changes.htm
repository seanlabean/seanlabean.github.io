    Notes for 03H:
        - back into running
        - back to programming C game. Let's integrate my drawings!
        - protest at Independence Hall. No Kings!

<h3>03H</h3>
<article>
    <p>I'm trying to get back into running again. Leaping headlong into high mileage is not the move, though. I am quick to injury with my damned right leg. I expect I am going to eventually require surgery or targeted steroid injections of some kind.</p>
    <p>As part of my weekly meetings with my coding crew I am getting back into programming in C. I'm a bit burnt out on following a tutorial line by line though I am very pleased by how much I've learned in this manner. I've been making a lot of 1bit drawings lately and figured this would be a good opportunity to make a game using those. I don't know the first thing about sprite sheets or game assets and certainly nothing about 3d assets. But, I can make decent 2d black and white art. Maybe I'll make a point and click adventure of some kind.</p>
    <p>We protested against our demonstrably authoritarian government at Independence Hall.</p>

    <p>Down and down.</p>
    <p>I developed a passing interest in the Forth programming language. Fascinating construction and a very different way of thinking about computation. I followed some guides and wrote a text-parsing program which takes a custom Markdown-like file (I call it Myrrtext) and makes the text HTML compliant. The program is built to recognize special characters within the Myrrtext and jumps to and executes special Forth functions (a.k.a. words) which modify the text or insert HTML element markers. In this sense, the Myrrtext itself is self-modifying.</p>
    <p>We saw the peak of the Philadelphia cherry blossoms on a cold misty day. Brought my camera, but no great picture opportunities. Still, it was a fun outing with friends.</p>
    <p>I've started meeting weekly with a group of friends to talk about our own programming projects as a way to stay motivated and accountable.</p>

        We went to Puerto Rico! We rented a car in San Juan from a highly questionable rental car company, which ended up being completely fine, and drove two and a half hours to the south western corner of the island. Guanica national forest. We relaxed at a beautiful beach resort and prepped for our purpose for being there: a wedding! And better yet, I was a groomsman! Such an honor and what a wonderful place to celebrate. Made some new friends too. Overall it was a very successful bout of travel, I'm proud of us for that.

        I started working through a tutorial of making several video games in C. I intend to lear the language this way. I am at first resistant to the fact that I am basically resigned to copying the tutorial line by line, but I figure might as well develop the muscle memory of the language and hope I pick up some syntax quirks along the way. No need to make this hard.

        Though I hate talking about politics here as it generally makes me angry and sad, I think it's important to note that I believe this jaunt marks the beginnings of a true constitutional crisis. The only thing I feel I have the power to do right now is be aware and live my life to the fullest in spite of the disaster around me.

        I learned how to roll over a 401k. I feel both financially responsible and savvy!

        I consolidated all of my graphical and textual art programs into a my sonoshee project space. I was pleasantly surprised at the volume of genuinely cool pieces of generative art I've developed over the years.

        Back to the Pw/S project, I want to revitalize my introductory physics knowledge in case I'll need it again soon (more on that later).

        More 1 bit drawings! I've mostly finished my fantasy world map and made two other drawings of some of the underground cities. It's fun posting these on Mastodon and Bsky. I like having these small communities of real (see: non-bot) people who I don't know in real life and yet still seem to like my creations. I even had someone say they liked my art style. I didn't even know I had a style. I didn't know I could <em>ever</em> have a style.

        I've hit 50 subscribers on <a href="pws.html">Pw/S</a>! I've been streaming my Skyrim playthrough. Still no consistent viewers, but someone seems to like my stuff!

        Went to a Flyers game in an ice storm for my friend's bachelor party. It was fun! And I cant wait for his wedding. The Eagles won the Superbowl the next day.

        I've continued toying with an idea for a fantasy world. A society many thousands of years in the future, all underground thriving in the caverns and rifts. I'm working some elements of magic in, but I like thinking about the political implications of the world. I don't have a driving hook yet but I'm going to stick with this and just assume something comes along eventually.

        I started and completed the game Outer Wilds. The game was quite fun. I was tripped up a couple times though because of a constant habit of overthinking things. Since I knew absolutely nothing about the game going into it, I had no clue how complicated or not the puzzles were. No spoilers here, but if you want to watch me play through the whole thing, I've livestreamed everything on <a href="pws.html">Pw/S</a>.

        I took apart my trusty laptop and replaced its CMOS battery! A painfully simple operation but just enough to get me used to staring into my computer's guts.

        A slow and sicky start to the year. Not a whole lot going on yet but I am excited to reset my priorities and start the year off with some intention. I've started using a wider array of the 100r/Varvara ecosystem, specifically Noodle for 1-bit drawings. I find it quite relaxing to draw something simple and am amazed at the level of artistry that exists in the 1-bit space. Some absolutely incredible pieces are out there in addition to seemingly endless possibilities for simple characters and icons. I can't wait to keep exploring. I've started making a map of an imaginary world as well which has been a lot of fun. I'll share it here on the wiki once I have some backstories written up.

        Otherwise, I have been forcing myself to engage in the somewhat intimidating world of Linux. Installing packages and such is easy enough, but I recently had to do something that would have paralyzed me a few years ago: installing printer drivers. I didn't know what a driver was, why it was important, or what to do with it. Why can't I just plug a printer in and just print something?? I'm proud of myself though, I did the research and figured it out, and now I look back at my confused self and feel great knowing it was so easy to break out of that paralysis.

        I purchased a suit for our upcoming wedding we are attending in Puerto Rico. I need to find a tailor next.
    </p>
    <p>
        This year I have several goals that I am particularly excited about:
        <ul>
            <li>Clean out clothes and reorganize.</li>
            <li>Go to a dry cleaners and tailor and figure out how all that works.</li>
            <li>Replace my laptop's CMOS battery by following a guide.</li>
            <li>Make 1-bit stickers and sell them at a market.</li>
            <li>Reach 100 subscribers on <a href="pws.html">Pw/S</a>.</li>
            <li>Sign up for an run a 5k, 10k, and half marathon.</li>
        </ul>
