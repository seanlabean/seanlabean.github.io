<h3>03Y</h3>
<article>
    <p>Another life-altering transitionary jaunt. What a year. These were my last two weeks as a Data Engineer at Primex. We parted ways amicably, my idea. The final days were hectic as expected but overall I think the impression I left, after my year and three months there, was a positive one. In coming entries I'll talk more about where I am headed.</p>
    <p>My trail running shoes got delivered: Brooks Cascadia 19s. Upon immediate reflection, definitely overkill for the trails around here in southern Indiana (at least on dry summer days). But in snowy conditions or on wet leaf-covered trails the massive lugs are more than appropriate. I was able to take them for a spin for the first time a day after it snowed around 3in. The trails were a mix of snow, slush, leaves, and mud. I felt very comfy in the shoe and had only one slippage moment as I (too) rapidly came down a steep slope. I had forgotten how much I love trail running. It genuinely is the most pure sense of joy and fulfilment that I experience nowadays. I can't wait to get out there again and to participate in the local trail races.</p>
    <p>Two days after my inaugural run we were smacked with frigid arctic air. The daily high, at its worst, was 14 degrees. With windchill, 3 degrees. We hunkered down and made it through mostly unscathed, one of Ashley's tires didn't make it and had to be replaced.</p>
    <p>我买了一个新桌子和椅子。椅子叫 Herman Miller 是很舒服。我最喜欢。这个新桌子旁边我的旧桌子。我用我的旧桌子玩网游戏， 用新的桌子工作。</p>
    <p>Ashley was given a scholarship! She was nominated by her professors to represent the "area of fiber arts" at the university. We attended an awards ceremoy and subsequent undergrad art installation. I'm really glad we went, some awards were announced and no one appeared to accept them - awkward.</p>

<h3>03X</h3>
<article>
    <p>Found a new hiking spot in the area. I miss being running distance from miles and miles of well-manicured trails. Oh well. Some adjustment is needed to get used to driving 15-20 minutes to the nearest trail as well as getting used to completely unmarked paths with forks leading to nowhere. It really makes me appreciate the Parks department of states that care about outdoor spaces like CA or cities like Philadelphia. Anyways, southern Indiana is what I have to work with now. This hike was in a long since drained resevoir. According to the on-site information signs, the damn was built in the late 1800s but soon after the resevoir filled the designers realized the basin was made of pourous limestone and could not effectively hold water. After a few decades the dam breached and took out a few dozen farms.</p>
    <p>We went bowling with friends! Cosmic bowling specifically, which just means they bump the music and put black lights on. I didn't even realize it was happening, but I ended up bowling the best bowl I ever bowled: 168. Spectacular, especially considering I pulled a muscle in my ass on the first frame.</p>
    <p>It was Ashley's birthday week and we went out to dinner twice. Once at a thai restaurant with a group of her colleagues. We mosied home afterwards and had cake with everyone. For our second dinner (the next day) we went to the nicest restaurant in the whole city, evident by the appetizers being $18 instead of the usual $10 and the steak entree being a whopping $52. I am being half sarcastic here, we are still very used to being surrounded by dozens of expensive and desireable places to eat. Ashley got the monkfish.</p>
    <p>For Thanksgiving I ran a 5k in the morning with a few new friends. I ran a 26:26 and it was beyond frigid out. Windchill brought us down to 12 degrees. Absolutely brutal, but got it done nonetheless. Later we had friends over for Thanksgiving dinner. We got everything catered from IU, $100 to feed 8 people.</p>
    <p>Some snow finally fell after threatening to for two weeks. We've been 10-20 degrees below average for most of November. It just so happened that this burst of heavy thick-flaked snow started to fall during one of my two weekly evening runs. I was out with friends and the snow falling through the night was quite magical.</p>
</article>
<h3>03W</h3>
<article>
    <p>I've been making steady progress in my running. I'm up to a dozen miles per week, I run a 5k on Mondays and Wednesdays and then a long run of 6 miles or so on Saturdays. I had a surprise encounter with some of SYRG members on their own Saturday long run. I joined up and it turned an otherwise meh run into a smile-filled adventure. I believe they run 5 or 10 miles starting at a corner of Bryan park at 9am (noting this so I can remember for next week). I signed up for a 10 mile trail run through the Morgan Monroe forest in mid January. I am stressing about whether I should buy gortex trail shoes (which are useless and downright detrimental during the majority of the year when its warm) on the off chance there's a massive snowstorm and I need something waterproof to avoid frostbite.</p>
    <p>Speaking of snow, the first of the season fell in the first week of November. A tad early, and it was all melted a day or two later, but it was a stark reminder that the winters here suck just as much as the east coast.</p>
    <p>While the snow was still on the ground we were treated to a rare sight: aurora borealis! A massive solar storm pushed the aurora line down to us, it was even visible in northern Georgia! It was crazy to think the sun was ionizing the oxygen over our heads: silent flickering wisps of red and green.</p>

    <p>I completely neglected to mention last jaunt that Drawtober had begun! And now that it is finished I am happy to report I successfully made it through all 31 drawings! This year was easier than last, I was much more leniant on myself and the time required to produce a piece of work. Some of my favorites can be found on my <a href="534C.html">534C page</a>.</p>
    <figure><img src="../media/refs/drawtober25-oozecube.png" style="width:45%; float:right"/></figure>
    <p>From my Mastodon <a href="https://mas.to/@slew/115486956729449972">post</a>: <q>That was a fun #drawtober. I made it a point to only use #uxn ‘s noodle for my drawings. I learned some new things about how noodle works and was introduced to supporting tools to help draw geometric shapes. I was very pleased that something as simple as discovering how to quickly draw a circle blew me away. My mind blossomed with new ideas of what was possible in my drawings. Some of my drawings were quick and sloppy, some I sunk 2 hours into and really really like. I am proud of all of them.</q></p>
    <p>I helped Ashley set up an art project for a critique. It was a hanging installation of sheets of Organza fabric arranged to look like a floating ghostly doorway. The setup process was a lot of fun to be a part of, I like being involved in something that I know will be appreciated by others. And the end result was spectacular, I am very proud of her and her work.</p>
    <p>It's Halloween time. Ashley made her costume: a fish. And I was a fisherman. We went to our friend's house for a nice house party. I feel like I am becoming more accustomed to our new friend group.</p>
    <p>I am back to a more purposeful Chinese learning routine again. I had a temporary lapse in motivation due to the perceived slow progress alongside the lack of stimulation from my usual apps and learning vectors. My expectation remains that I will achieve HSK Level 1 competency by May 2026.</p>
    <p>On the last day of this jaunt I joined a croissant making workshop at the Muddy Fork Bakery. Muddy Fork is the only fully brick fired bakery in Indiana and is a small family-run operation nestled in the woods 25 minutes north of Bloomington. I spent most of they day there, 9:30am to 5:30pm, made myself 8 croissants, and met many great and fun people! Croisants are finicky bakes but relatively easy to put together. I don't think I'd make my own at home any time soon, I dont have nearly enough counter space.</p>
    <p>My grandfather Keith Kvenvolden passed away. He was a NASA and USGS scientist and so much more. I don't have any grandparents anymore.</p>

<article>
    <p>Third summer, had a few days nearly hit the 80s again.</p>
    <p>Took Renna in to the vet to see Dr. Dale. I like Dr. Dale, he's kind and a cat owner himself. We opted for a parasite and viral scan, they use some sort of DNA sequencer. Apparently 15 years ago such a thing required a room-sized machine and $10,000 per scan, now it's a box that fits on a desk and can pinpoint various species' DNA for a few hundred bucks. There was no evidence of parasites or viruses in Renna, so we still don't know why she keeps having a few days of normal poops and intermitent diarrhea. I know that crickets have been getting into the house, and she is for sure eating them, I see their legs scattered around some mornings, but those apparently should not be harmful. We might end up doing an endoscopy.</p>
    <p>I had a long conversation with my friend from grad school Andrew, more on that to come.</p>
    <p>We attended a live visual art performance at the local drive-in theater called Signal Overload. The drive-in is very nice and we will definitely be returning. There is something so fun about being able to listen to a movie through the car's soundsystem while yapping away with Ashley and not having to worry about disturbing anyone.</p>
    <p>Got the covid and flu booster, hit me pretty hard this time. I had one rough day and two sweaty nights. A small price to pay to ensure I don't get wrecked for a week or more this winter.</p>
    <p>We've been continuing to go to the farmers' market every Saturday morning. Our usual haul is fresh eggs, large beef tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and other veggies like okra.</p>
    <p>We watched Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak at the IU cinema and ate at an indian buffet during the No Kings protest.</p>

<article>
    <p>Settled back into the Bloomington home. We've finally unpacked by the end of this jaunt and the old creaky place is really feeling like home.</p>
    <p>I emailed Catherine Pilachowski, the Indiana University Astronomy department head, on a whim to ask about opportunities for an ex-academic like myself to jump back into the astronomy fray. I had discovered her while I was looking through the American Astronomical Society directory (I was renewing my yearly membership) and saw that she was the regional AAS representative. She also was the AAS president in the early 2000s! To my complete surprise she emailed back and with a wealth of information on how to become more involved in the various astronomy groups and events. She also floated the possibility of me being a visiting lecturer during the sping or summer.</p>
    <p>We went to the IU theater to see My Neighbor Totoro, $1 tickets. The theater is quite nice, though just one screen.</p>
    <p>My run club SYRG had a potluck dinner after our Wednesday run, I baked cookies! It was a great showing of 30+ people with more than enough bbq and side dishes to go around. A few days later I went to the Hoosiers Outrun Cancer 5k, met up with the SYRG group and pushed through a very hot and muggy morning to get a decent sub-30 time. Ashley came out to support at the portion of the race near her studio. It was the most people I've ever run with and was a very powerful scene with cancer survivors running along with stand-out red shirts.</p>
    <p>Later in the day after the 5k we hosted a potluck party at our home! Ashley's cohort of first-year MfA students came by, around 10 in total. And it was quite fun, we eat and drank and played Monikers and Whatchyamadrawit.</p>
    <p>I've been keeping up with my conversations with Ana. Though I am beginning to feel the drag of procrastination slowing me down. I think I need a way to acquire new words or phrases, write them down, and force myself to use them in conversation with her.</p>

<h3>03S</h3>
<article>
    <p>Working remote for another week in Sunnyvale. It is tough to keep with the east coast schedule, especially starting at 8am EST. I'm up at 4:15am every day, take a 10 minute walk through the dark to the just-opened Starbucks for a coffee and madelines, and then take by morning meetings in the dark while the world wakes up. On each of my early-morning walks through the dark I witnessed a curious event. A large owl flying low overhead, a man arrested in the shopping mall parking lot, a group of men huddled around a car who all got in and drove away when they saw me, a house with a single light on and a woman saying "hey!" loudly over and over again. The last one stood out to me as the most unnerving moment. The voice was not screaming or seemingly seeking help, but it was loud enough to hear from the empty quiet street. The most unnerving aspect was that it did not stop, I heard it when walked to the Starbucks and it was still sounding 15 minutes later &mdash; the same timbre, same word, same volume, same 5 second interval between calls.</p>
    <p>I had a nice meal out with both Jake and Ella, ramen and traditional chinese food respectively. I was able to meet with gramps a few more times too. I read him my poems in progress, Jon had a funny review of them: "upon reflection I liked them more than I did initially". Classic Jon.</p>
    <p>I flew back home to Indiana. The hour drive from the airport to home is not ideal but there's little traffic and with the airport parking being so cheap I can see us going on little weekend trips frequently. I joined a Bloomington run club called Switch Yard Run Group (SYRG), they have 2x per week runs that start a 3 minute walk from our house. They are so much more organized than any club I've gone to. They have a Strava presence where they upload Team goals and run routes, otterpops are brought to every run, they have bbq get togethers.</p>
    <p>Ending this jaunt I had my first of hopefully many conversations with Ana Lian all in chinese (mostly). I was pretty nervous throughout this, but it's inpired me to be better prepared next time. At the very least I expect to be very proficient at phrases like "say that again", "I dont understand", "how do you say..."</p>

    <p>Labor day was the everything day. It started off badly when I consciously did not take out the trash the night before, thinking that the garbagemen would not come on a holiday (they never did in Philly). Turns out they do in Bloomington. 5am I was awoken to the sound of garbagemen shooting the shit and crashing around the truck. Too late for us, we'd have to live with an overflowing trashcan of rotting sun-baked garbage for another week. Then, I slept in, another bad sign. I hate losing the morning. Once we finally got rolling I received news from my mom that my grandfather was ailing rapidly. I was already planning to fly out to CA for my cousin's wedding the next weekend but didn't build in time to see gramps. So I quickly reorganized my travel to take me into SFO 3 days early and to stay a whole extra week. This would mean working from 4am to 2pm every day, but it would mean being able to see gramps and have time to spare to avoid a rushed travel.</p>
    <p>Seeing gramps was tough. I have thought about the experience a lot but wont describe details here. I am so proud of my mom and my uncle for how much work she is doing to take care of him.</p>
    <p>The wedding was nice. It was in Tahoe beneath the pines. It was fun to see my family all dressed up and having a good time. And luckily there were no breakdowns or stressful moments. I think it helps in a wedding when you know there are others who are infinitely more stressed than you.</p>

<article>
    <p>I've escape the ticks, as far as I can tell. Staggering to say the least.</p>
    <p>Ashley arrived! She certainly had a more arduous drive than I did. The 11 hour drive from Philly turned into more like a 15 hour drive because of a massive accident on I-70W blocking both lanes of traffic. She was at a standstill for 3 hours! I got her a hotel room in Dayton where she stayed overnight and continued on the next day. If it was going to happen, at least it happened that way, a way we could cope with, and at least Renna was not stuck with her too!</p>
    <p>I've established a progression tracker for my learning mandarin. It's nothing more than a <code>.ods</code> document that tracks the current day, notes how far along I am towards my goal, and summarizes my points of progress. I don't exactly know how this will help me yet, but I'm allowing it to be a living document which may shift over time as my needs change.</p>
    <p>I've started physical therapy again for my leg. Awful expensive, but my hope is this will be an opportunity to really stick to the plan and avoid having to go in for a surgery, or at least I can get myself into the best shape possible before a surgery or something serious.</p>
</article>
<h3>03P</h3>
<article>
    <p>All our prep and thowing things away and packing things has led to this! Renna and I made the 12 hour drive from Philly to Bloominton, all in one go. It was around hour 8 that I started feeling the toll and the final hour and a half, most of which was in standstill Indianapolis traffic, was excruciating. All I wanted at that point was a nice well maintained hotel room. Needless to say, my reaction was far from positive when I rolled up to our 120 year old home, no furniture, doorknob falling off, and scuffed up floors. Beyond that, the act of then blowing up my air mattress to then sleep of the ravaged floors sealed the deal, I hated this place. BUT I want to make clear that my opinion of our home has changed drastically even just a week since then. Sure it's old and has its creaky quirks. But I actually enjoy how simple its construction is, especially how all the piping and wiring can be plainly seen if you go into the basement and look up. I was able to easily trace the coax cable back to the source and figure out why the internet was not working. Every pipe and gas line is apparent and easy to understand. I love how much easier it is to understand the house as a system, rather than having pipes and wires all around you like in an apartment complex. On top of that, the home has a brand new heater/AC, brand new gas stove, new fridge and washer. So it's got "good bones" as they say.</p>
    <p>Bloomington is a pretty nice place too. I spent my first few work days nestled in the coworking space The Mill. At $100/mo I think it will give me a good place to feel accountable and surrounded by other hard working people, rather than be holed up at home all week. The food in Bloomington is questionable. The options are severely limited compared to Philly, there is one chinese place worth going, one mexican place, one thai place. This will take some getting used to, I hope to do much more cooking and baking at home. In the one week I've been here, I've met more people than I have in the last year in Philly. Everyone is very easy to talk to and more importantly very willing to share a 15 minute conversation. Life just seems to move a little slower here. It's back to school season, parents are leading their college kids around the (only) Target, and yet it didn't feel overcrowded or like I was in a mosh pit like I do most times back in Philly. This perception was put into stark contrast the other day when I was talking to a store attendant who had just graduated from Nashville Indiana high school, a 50 person class. They were commenting about how amazing Bloomington was but how crowded all the stores were this time of year, how incredible all the food choices were, but how crowded all the shops get this time of year. I couldn't believe it. But I guess it makes sense if you grew up and lived your whole life in a 3-stop-light town in southern Indiana.</p>
    <p>Some good and some real bad happened thoughout this first week. The good: I was able to get a solid road bike for $100 and met an awesome bike shop owner who is fixing it up all nice, I met some new people who I hope to be friends with, our belongings were delivered mostly without a hitch and it makes the house feel much homier even with it all still in boxes. The bad: I went on a short walk through an unmaintained trail and my ankle brushed up against a tick nest. My ankle and foot were covered in hundreds of tiny poppyseed-sized ticks. I did my best to brush them off, rushed to the nearest CVS and lint roller-ed my whole body then washed with tick shampoo meant for dogs. Now I wait and see if any have got me and whether I've contracted Lyme or worse.</p>

    <p>We're starting to ramp up our packing efforts in preparation for the big move from Philly to Bloomington. It doesn't quite feel real yet, and I don't think I've fully accepted the impending toll that a 12 hour drive will take on my body and mind. But we'll make it.</p>
    <p>I had another burst of inspiration in and around my <a href="vindauga.html">Vindauga</a> project. In the last episode, I figured out how to render text to the screen and paired it as a caption to a series of photo album images. I realized, though, that I could also have whole pages of text rendered alongside an image, like a picture book or a series of poem-image pairs. I took this opportunity to write some code to dynamically load the text data from an external file, that way I can change elements of text without having to recompile the executable over and over. I'm really liking Vindauga and the variants it has morphed into, but I think it's about time I sat down and actually created a finished product with one of these things!</p>

    <p>Took a long train ride from Philly up to Beacon, NY. Amtrak to Moynihan Station, walk 30 minutes past Bryant Park and Times Square to Grand Central, Hudson line to Beacon. This was probably the last time I will be walking though Manhattan in a long while, and that makes me a bit sad. There truly is no other place quite like Manhattan on a Thursday evening in Summer. Rolling my go-bag over the gum-stained sidewalks, weaving through hustling business people and oblivious tourists, I felt simultaneously overwhelmed, safe, and ecstatic. Eventually, after 7 hours of travel, I made it to Beacon at 11pm at night where Ashley picked me up. After a final 1 hour drive through the pitch black stretches of highway through Wonder Lake state park and the NY CT border.</p>
    <p>We spent the 4th of July at Ashley's parents' place in New Milford.  They hosted a party with a dozen or so attendees from their church. All the older party goers spoke Mandarin primarily, which gave me a chance to test how much I've learned so far (and gave me a powerful flashback to being back in China). My Mardarin vocabulary failed me nearly completely, but I was able to pick up on a few things like "son" or "watermelon" that allowed me to understand the context of the conversation.</p>
    <p><b><code>03N03</code></b> - This was a long time coming. After two months of designing and creating a ring, two weeks of planning with Ashley's siblings, and seven years of dating, I proposed to Ashley in a field of wild wheat in the western hills of Conneticut. And she said yes!</p>

        I am leaning fully into learning Mandarin now. Seven years to go for fluency. I wrote my first <a href="mandarin.html">iOS app</a>, allowing me to store hanzi flashcards as csv data which I can then load into the app and view as simple flashcards. I can rate the cards with a difficulty level and weight their visibility based on this weight.

    We traveled to Asia. Two weeks abroad exploring and visiting family in Taiwan and China. This was an incredible and demanding experience that I will remember forever. I have a lot of work ahead of me to curate my photography and make a Vindauga zine and blog post. The most lasting effects of this trip will certainly be my resolution to learn Mandarin. I want to be professionally fluent in 7 years. I also refactored Vindauga to act as a simple digital photo album to cycle through my trip pictures. I think once I add the functionality to load in all images in a folder rather than hard-coding them I should publish it as a separate program. It works surprisingly well and the act of loading all images into a buffer at startup means there is no load time when clicking between images which is convenient.

    One of the benefits of having 12-hour jet lag is the temporary ability to make use of early morning hours. After waking fully rested at 4:30am, we made our way out to the John Heinz wildlife sanctuary where I took pictures of tree and barn swallows, great and great blue herons, and other birds. I submitted a picture of a tree swallow to a local photo competition.

<article>
    <p><a href="vindauga.html">Vindauga</a> has come a long way and I am pleased to report that it has reached a final draft of sorts. I imagine I will be adding many features to it and refactoring some of the clutter for many months to come but the core functionality is there. A few of the final core components were: scene memory - the ability to navigate backards through previously visited scenes, music, text rendering, clickable visualization with debug switch. I was also able to find a memory leak which was causing the footprint to grow linearly with time. One of the first enhancements I intend to make is to dynamically load the scene images only when they are navigated to, at the moment all images are loaded once at the start of the program. 
    </p>
    <p>Otherwise we are scambling to prepare for our major adventure of the year: a 2-week trip to Taiwan and China! Very excited for this.</p>

    <p>I've been working hard on my point-and-click SDL2 game. So far so good! It's been incredibly rewarding to meet weekly with the boys, it has been keeping my progress steady. And it's also cool to see what other people are working on and how they flex their skills to make something interesting. I comfortably created a little scene where clicking on a region displays a new image, right clicking returns you to the starting image, all while some atmospheric music plays in the background. I hit a couple snags trying to flesh the system out into something fully extensible, I am currently trying to figure out a way to track what image the player is currently looking at and what they were previously looking at so that right-clicking takes you back to that image, not just to the starting image. The boys had a good suggestion of using a tree structure of some sort. I am calling the game vindauga, old-norse for "wind's eye", which was subsumed into the English language as "window". I've been keeping a log of all my developments, using my forth-based HTML parser <a href="myrr.html">myrr</a>. You can read the blog <a href="vindauga.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm trying to get back into running again. Leaping headlong into high mileage is not the move, though. I am quick to injury with my damned right leg. I expect I am going to eventually require surgery or targeted steroid injections of some kind.</p>
    <p>As part of my weekly meetings with my coding crew I am getting back into programming in C. I'm a bit burnt out on following a tutorial line by line though I am very pleased by how much I've learned in this manner. I've been making a lot of 1bit drawings lately and figured this would be a good opportunity to make a game using those. I don't know the first thing about sprite sheets or game assets and certainly nothing about 3d assets. But, I can make decent 2d black and white art. Maybe I'll make a point and click adventure of some kind.</p>

    <p>Down and down.</p>
    <p>I developed a passing interest in the Forth programming language. Fascinating construction and a very different way of thinking about computation. I followed some guides and wrote a text-parsing program which takes a custom Markdown-like file (I call it Myrrtext) and makes the text HTML compliant. The program is built to recognize special characters within the Myrrtext and jumps to and executes special Forth functions (a.k.a. words) which modify the text or insert HTML element markers. In this sense, the Myrrtext itself is self-modifying.</p>
    <p>We saw the peak of the Philadelphia cherry blossoms on a cold misty day. Brought my camera, but no great picture opportunities. Still, it was a fun outing with friends.</p>
    <p>I've started meeting weekly with a group of friends to talk about our own programming projects as a way to stay motivated and accountable.</p>

        We went to Puerto Rico! We rented a car in San Juan from a highly questionable rental car company, which ended up being completely fine, and drove two and a half hours to the south western corner of the island. Guanica national forest. We relaxed at a beautiful beach resort and prepped for our purpose for being there: a wedding! And better yet, I was a groomsman! Such an honor and what a wonderful place to celebrate. Made some new friends too. Overall it was a very successful bout of travel, I'm proud of us for that.

        I started working through a tutorial of making several video games in C. I intend to lear the language this way. I am at first resistant to the fact that I am basically resigned to copying the tutorial line by line, but I figure might as well develop the muscle memory of the language and hope I pick up some syntax quirks along the way. No need to make this hard.

        Though I hate talking about politics here as it generally makes me angry and sad, I think it's important to note that I believe this jaunt marks the beginnings of a true constitutional crisis. The only thing I feel I have the power to do right now is be aware and live my life to the fullest in spite of the disaster around me.

        I learned how to roll over a 401k. I feel both financially responsible and savvy!

        I consolidated all of my graphical and textual art programs into a my sonoshee project space. I was pleasantly surprised at the volume of genuinely cool pieces of generative art I've developed over the years.

        Back to the Pw/S project, I want to revitalize my introductory physics knowledge in case I'll need it again soon (more on that later).

        More 1 bit drawings! I've mostly finished my fantasy world map and made two other drawings of some of the underground cities. It's fun posting these on Mastodon and Bsky. I like having these small communities of real (see: non-bot) people who I don't know in real life and yet still seem to like my creations. I even had someone say they liked my art style. I didn't even know I had a style. I didn't know I could <em>ever</em> have a style.

        I've hit 50 subscribers on <a href="pws.html">Pw/S</a>! I've been streaming my Skyrim playthrough. Still no consistent viewers, but someone seems to like my stuff!

        Went to a Flyers game in an ice storm for my friend's bachelor party. It was fun! And I cant wait for his wedding. The Eagles won the Superbowl the next day.

        I've continued toying with an idea for a fantasy world. A society many thousands of years in the future, all underground thriving in the caverns and rifts. I'm working some elements of magic in, but I like thinking about the political implications of the world. I don't have a driving hook yet but I'm going to stick with this and just assume something comes along eventually.

        I started and completed the game Outer Wilds. The game was quite fun. I was tripped up a couple times though because of a constant habit of overthinking things. Since I knew absolutely nothing about the game going into it, I had no clue how complicated or not the puzzles were. No spoilers here, but if you want to watch me play through the whole thing, I've livestreamed everything on <a href="pws.html">Pw/S</a>.

        I took apart my trusty laptop and replaced its CMOS battery! A painfully simple operation but just enough to get me used to staring into my computer's guts.

        A slow and sicky start to the year. Not a whole lot going on yet but I am excited to reset my priorities and start the year off with some intention. I've started using a wider array of the 100r/Varvara ecosystem, specifically Noodle for 1-bit drawings. I find it quite relaxing to draw something simple and am amazed at the level of artistry that exists in the 1-bit space. Some absolutely incredible pieces are out there in addition to seemingly endless possibilities for simple characters and icons. I can't wait to keep exploring. I've started making a map of an imaginary world as well which has been a lot of fun. I'll share it here on the wiki once I have some backstories written up.

        Otherwise, I have been forcing myself to engage in the somewhat intimidating world of Linux. Installing packages and such is easy enough, but I recently had to do something that would have paralyzed me a few years ago: installing printer drivers. I didn't know what a driver was, why it was important, or what to do with it. Why can't I just plug a printer in and just print something?? I'm proud of myself though, I did the research and figured it out, and now I look back at my confused self and feel great knowing it was so easy to break out of that paralysis.
