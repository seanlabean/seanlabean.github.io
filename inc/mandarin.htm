    <h2>I've taken it upon myself to talk the talk</h2>
    <p>I started learning Mandarin on <code>03K08</code>. For the time being, this page will serve as a dumping ground for learning resources as well as notes on my experience. In the past, I have found that I become very eager to find as many resources as possible, become overwhelmed, forget to keep track of the resources, and eventually get bored and quit. I want to prevent that from happening by currating a space where I may always return to and grab something new and interesting for myself of to point other learners to.</p>
