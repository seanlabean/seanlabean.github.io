        Pw/S is a video-based public education and entertainment adventure, growing out of the efforts of the <a href="atavata.html">ATAVATA</a> project, and focusing on science communication and gaming. Physics was a natural place to start for me as I have the foundational knowledge and teaching experience. Astrophysics pop-science in particular appealed to me as it seemed to be a thriving community of educators, endless content, and a naturally participatory audience. The Pw/S content assembly line amounted to semi-daily Instagram/TikTok carousel posts on Astronomical content, weekly Physics Fridays problem solving videos, and irregular gaming and computer science livestreams.

    <h3>tutoring</h3>
    <p>
        I am very pleased with myself that I managed to snatch up the physicswithsean handles across all major social media platforms in addition to the .com website. I have a far-flung vision of managing my own little static website there hosting a tutoring service, maybe embedding my videos, etc. But I am so desperately hopeless at web design that I opted for a free Google-site. It actually looks pretty decent and the hardest part of setting it up was mucking around with the DNS to get the https redirect working right. In any event, having this plot of digital land secured bodes well for the future of Pw/S. I feel a tangible level of comfort knowing that I can fall back on this source of purpose and income if I really needed to.

    <h3>manim</h3>
    <p>
        I designed, scripted, and recorded audio for the weekly physics problem solving videos using the Python library <a href="https://www.manim.community/">manim</a>. Manim is purpose built for mathematic visualizations and animations. I encourage you, reader, to look at some example videos using the library, the extent of its performance is astounding. I managed to develop a rocky but functional system to quickly program animated problem statements and dynamic free-body diagrams. I had an astute sense that I had barely begun to scratch the surface and release the full power of manim. I did find it very well designed and convenient, especially in its ability to record voice-overs and then render select animations accordingly based on the duration of the audio. The learning curve is extremely steep, perhaps prohibitively so for those who do not already know how to program.

    <h3>gaming</h3>
    <p>Computer games are obviously the odd-topic-out here, but nevertheless they make consistent appearances on the Pw/S channel. Upon reflection, gaming holds a significant nostalgic place in my heart, and the medium serves as a wonderful stage for storytelling and entertainment. If anything, I enjoy recording the experiences for myself to review later, especially when the content is mostly just my brother and I chatting. Streamed games include Elden Ring and Outer Wilds.</p>
