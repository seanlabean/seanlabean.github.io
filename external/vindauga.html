<h2>Dev Log </h2><p><b>03I05</b> - Next up: a data tree for the Scenes! I think having one central point of truth for Scene navigation will be nice, though it could also be possible to have a single dynamic list, which does not need to know about a central point of Scene organization. I don't think either one of these is the <i>right</i> way of doing this, merely a matter of preference at this point. I guess a central navigation map would be more efficient computationally. Secondly, I'd like to make a hover effect for when you are over a clickable item. This should be easy, just move the check Left-Click logic into the mouse position block for each Scene, and then call a <code>draw()</code> before checking for clicks. </p>
<p><b>03I03</b> - I have the basic structure and flow of the game established now. It will be a point-and-click style exploration game where scences can be discovered and observed. Each scene will be a low-res 1bit image (currently 128x128) with two states to give an sense of movement and life.
</p>
<p>There's a few things I know will have to be developed quickly and soon to make the game fully functional. At the moment, right-clicking sends the player back to the starting Scene (0) regardless of what Scene they are in. Once the Storyboard gets anything more than one level deep, I will need to be able to keep track of the player's path, which Scenes they have been to and in which order in order to navigate backwards. The easiest thing I can think of is a simple array that I append each Scene ID to and pop Scene IDs off whenever the user navigates backwards, that way the tail of the array is always the current Scene. I say "simple array" but of course when working with C there are complications. I'll have to program my own <code>append()</code> and <code>pop()</code> functions from scratch. Maybe there's an easier way to do this? For now, I will try this and learn along the way. There's some other considerations nesteled within this effort as well: what if I want to keep track of Scene-based player states? Say the player talks to a character and that action changes something about the Scene (requiring a render of a distinct image file), how do I keep track of that once the user navigates away? Sounds like the job for a Scene struct. But, before I get too carried away and frozen by the mountains of new things to learn, let's keep things basic.
</p>
<p>Another thing I am thinking about is the music and how it is handled. Right now, the music is loaded and called to play once, during the game initialization. If I want to play Scene-specific music, I'll need a way to call music loads and plays from within the game loop without repeatedly calling them every frame. Not sure how to do this, but I suspect I will be able to monitor the music Channels to see if anything is currently playing and choose not to reinitialize.
</p>
<p>Finally (for now) I want to add a transition between Scenes, something like a fade out/in to/from black. Again, no idea how to do this but my assumption is that something to this effect already exists within SDL.
