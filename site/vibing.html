    <h2>On LLMs and Vibecoding</h2>
    <p>
        <b><code>03L02</code></b> was when I first experienced vibecoding. Prior to this, I had used LLMs relatively sparingly at my job and for my side projects, mostly treating the models as a second pair of hands to assist me in my efforts. This was different. This was reliquishing nearly all programming work over to the invisible churning mass of neurons and activation functions called Claude. At the time, I had just embarked on my mission to learn Mandarin. After collecting several online resources including game-ified apps, podcasts, and goverment issued documents, I realized I had no easy (and free) way to study Hanzi characters. At least, there was no way to customize the set of characters I wanted to focus on. How awesome would it be to make my own iOS app that does exactly this? And so I did. Or rather, Claude did.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the cost of nothing (nothing being a relative term here, since no dollars were exchanged but Anthropic now has my email and data about me worth some unknown value) fully functioning Swift code appeared before my eyes, mirroring my every design idea. My only task was then to copy the code into Xcode and build it to the simulator. Poof, my app. Absolutely incredible. From idea to app in 20 minutes. That said, the app looked like shit, was a little clunky, had a few bugs, and was lacking on features. But, all that was addressed with two or three more chat messages with Claude. By version 7 of the code my <a href="mandarin.html">app was finished</a>, at least for my purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Have I done something wrong here? I felt pleased, but also like I had just partaken in some obscene act. The online discorse around AI is planted firmly in the antagonistic corner; AI is bad, a blight on the world, spawn of technocratic thiefs. Beyond that, I had just created something from an unworthy personal knowledge base. Sure I have years of Python and C programming experience, but I've never written in Swift before and have never made a smartphone app before. I commanded this thing to be built and here it is, and I don't know and never will need to know how it works or how to make it myself. I've committed a 2025 cardinal sin: I have vibecoded, produced software by only conversing with an AI bot. And yet, this sin produced an app that will be genuinely helpful to me that now exists where as it may have taken me months to learn the language and accomplish the same thing. I love that. But still, I feel the urge to ask: have I done something wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
        For now, I will answer that question by exploring four others.
        <ol>
            <li>What have I lost by vibecoding?</li>
    <p>this is a test</p>
            <li>What has the world lost?</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>What I lose when vibecoding: without it I would have reached out to a developer, but they might have vibecoded too. Sense of growth.
        What I don't lose when vibecoding: a sense of accomplishment, a sense of pride, a sense of ownership.
    </p>
    <p>
        write some and then have claude write a continuing paragraph.
    </p>
