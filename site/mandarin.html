    <h2>I've taken it upon myself to talk the talk</h2>
    <p>I started learning Mandarin on <code>03K08</code>. For the time being, this page will serve as a dumping ground for learning resources as well as notes on my experience. In the past, I have found that I become very eager to find as many resources as possible, become overwhelmed, forget to keep track of the resources, and eventually get bored and quit. I want to prevent that from happening by currating a space where I may always return to and grab something new and interesting for myself of to point other learners to.</p>

    <h3>汉子 Cards</h3>
    <p>I immediately recognized a shortcoming in publically available mandarin practice resources, specifically their functionality on and compatability with the iPhone. Duolingo is notorious for its heavy handed ads, a free user must sit through 1 minute of ads for every 2 or three minutes of studying. Most of the adspace on Duolingo is reserved for their own internal SUPER plan ($12 per month) which gets rid of ads. This is, at worst, a bit annoying to deal with. However, Duolingo mandarin is still lacking to a significant degree compared to the Latin-based languages available and I cannot imagine that Duo alone will suffice as a way to become proficient in mandarin. HelloChinese is much more robust but locks a significant portion of its study materials like recorded conversations, written stories, etc. behind their own paywall (also around $12 per month). Less game-ified apps like Pleco are very useful in their own right, with some advanced features paywalled, but I don't believe such apps were meant to be true study buddies -- more like supplementary support. Podcasts are great for active listening, but lack any accompanying written material. Open source written materials like the PeaceCorps docs are great for quick study sprints but again are lacking in any sort of supporting data that is easily transcribed to study apps.</p>

    <p>But, so what? So there isn't one single app that does literally everything needed to learn a language AND is free? Ok you got me there. But thinking about these shortcomings got me thinking: "what service would truly help me learn mandarin faster?" One thing that has bothered me is how difficult it is to continuously be introduced to mandarin characters/words throught the written language (hanzi) and have no place to record this new addition to my knowledge. Sure, Duolingo and HelloChinese have "Review" games, but they don't give any control over which hanzi characters are presented. Indeed, all of these resources commonly lack any true flashcard-like study service. A hanzi flashcard app where I have direct control over the database of hanzi I want to study would be incredibly useful. Of course there are other apps which are meant exactly this, but they too have in-app purchases to get rid of ads, increase your flashcard deck size, etc. and often revolve around preset collections rather than fully customizable flashcard decs.</p>

    <p>All this to say, I built my own hanzi flashcard applet: <b>汉子 Cards</b></p>

    <figure>
        <img src="../media/refs/hanzi_cards.jpg" style="width:250px;float:right;"/>
    </figure>

    <p>My app can import CSV formatted data representing any number of flashcards which display the hanzi character or word with the pronounciation and definition on the reverse side. I've also included a text-to-speech module which reads the hanzi aloud. I also added a customizable difficulty settng for each card as well as a simple preferential weighting system which prefers to place harder cards at the top of the deck so the user is more likely to encounter them when the deck is shuffled.</p>

    <p><b>汉子 Cards</b> is meant to be simple to use and highly modular. It comes with the quirks of being a hand-made piece of software in that its modularity is entirely dependent on my own efforts of creating and currating CSV collections of hanzi characters and definitions. I've made a challenge for myself to actively use the app for 1 week straight and see if I feel any improvements and if I enjoy adding it to my study routine. I ultimately intend to make the app publically available, I think it would be really fun to share with other Mandarin learners. The modular CSV-based datasets mean that people can easily create custom card decks and immediately share them with others, no overhead or data processing needed! Or perhaps a professor provides a CSV of all the new characters and words for each unit, providing the students with a zero-cost method of continous study beamed directly into their pockets.</p>
