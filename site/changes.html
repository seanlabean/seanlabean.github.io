        We went to Puerto Rico! We rented a car in San Juan from a highly questionable rental car company, which ended up being completely fine, and drove two and a half hours to the south western corner of the island. Guanica national forest. We relaxed at a beautiful beach resort and prepped for our purpose for being there: a wedding! And better yet, I was a groomsman! Such an honor and what a wonderful place to celebrate. Made some new friends too. Overall it was a very successful bout of travel, I'm proud of us for that.

        I started working through a tutorial of making several video games in C. I intend to lear the language this way. I am at first resistant to the fact that I am basically resigned to copying the tutorial line by line, but I figure might as well develop the muscle memory of the language and hope I pick up some syntax quirks along the way. No need to make this hard.

        Though I hate talking about politics here as it generally makes me angry and sad, I think it's important to note that I believe this jaunt marks the beginnings of a true constitutional crisis. The only thing I feel I have the power to do right now is be aware and live my life to the fullest in spite of the disaster around me.

        I learned how to roll over a 401k. I feel both financially responsible and savvy!

        I consolidated all of my graphical and textual art programs into a my sonoshee project space. I was pleasantly surprised at the volume of genuinely cool pieces of generative art I've developed over the years.

        Back to the Pw/S project, I want to revitalize my introductory physics knowledge in case I'll need it again soon (more on that later).

        More 1 bit drawings! I've mostly finished my fantasy world map and made two other drawings of some of the underground cities. It's fun posting these on Mastodon and Bsky. I like having these small communities of real (see: non-bot) people who I don't know in real life and yet still seem to like my creations. I even had someone say they liked my art style. I didn't even know I had a style. I didn't know I could <em>ever</em> have a style.

        I've hit 50 subscribers on <a href="pws.html">Pw/S</a>! I've been streaming my Skyrim playthrough. Still no consistent viewers, but someone seems to like my stuff!

        Went to a Flyers game in an ice storm for my friend's bachelor party. It was fun! And I cant wait for his wedding. The Eagles won the Superbowl the next day.

        I've continued toying with an idea for a fantasy world. A society many thousands of years in the future, all underground thriving in the caverns and rifts. I'm working some elements of magic in, but I like thinking about the political implications of the world. I don't have a driving hook yet but I'm going to stick with this and just assume something comes along eventually.

        I started and completed the game Outer Wilds. The game was quite fun. I was tripped up a couple times though because of a constant habit of overthinking things. Since I knew absolutely nothing about the game going into it, I had no clue how complicated or not the puzzles were. No spoilers here, but if you want to watch me play through the whole thing, I've livestreamed everything on <a href="pws.html">Pw/S</a>.

        I took apart my trusty laptop and replaced its CMOS battery! A painfully simple operation but just enough to get me used to staring into my computer's guts.

        A slow and sicky start to the year. Not a whole lot going on yet but I am excited to reset my priorities and start the year off with some intention. I've started using a wider array of the 100r/Varvara ecosystem, specifically Noodle for 1-bit drawings. I find it quite relaxing to draw something simple and am amazed at the level of artistry that exists in the 1-bit space. Some absolutely incredible pieces are out there in addition to seemingly endless possibilities for simple characters and icons. I can't wait to keep exploring. I've started making a map of an imaginary world as well which has been a lot of fun. I'll share it here on the wiki once I have some backstories written up.

        Otherwise, I have been forcing myself to engage in the somewhat intimidating world of Linux. Installing packages and such is easy enough, but I recently had to do something that would have paralyzed me a few years ago: installing printer drivers. I didn't know what a driver was, why it was important, or what to do with it. Why can't I just plug a printer in and just print something?? I'm proud of myself though, I did the research and figured it out, and now I look back at my confused self and feel great knowing it was so easy to break out of that paralysis.

        I purchased a suit for our upcoming wedding we are attending in Puerto Rico. I need to find a tailor next.
    </p>
    <p>
        This year I have several goals that I am particularly excited about:
        <ul>
            <li>Clean out clothes and reorganize.</li>
            <li>Go to a dry cleaners and tailor and figure out how all that works.</li>
            <li>Replace my laptop's CMOS battery by following a guide.</li>
            <li>Make 1-bit stickers and sell them at a market.</li>
            <li>Reach 100 subscribers on <a href="pws.html">Pw/S</a>.</li>
            <li>Sign up for an run a 5k, 10k, and half marathon.</li>
        </ul>
