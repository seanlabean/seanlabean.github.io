        I've been reading <i>Authority</i> by Jeff VanderMeer. I'm enjoying it. I like the mystery and the unreliable narrator. I think I especially enjoy scifi/fantasy with some sort of deep-rooted unknown that we as the reader and the protagonist slowly discover over the course of the book. The most immediate example of this I can think of is <i>Piranesi</i>. I loved that book. I may even read it again soon.

        I let myself remain inspired by the inventive splash pages over at <a href="https://neocities.org/browse">NeoCities</a> and, in wanting to make something similar, I made a few gif background tiles using Devine Lu Linvega's <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/dotgrid.html">Dotgrid</a>. It actually turned out great dispite being not a super smooth process. I was able to make a few tiles and then use them in a simple HTML/CSS page. I was able to get the tiles to animate and loop and I was very pleased with the result. An example of this can now be seen on my <a href="atavata.html">ATAVATA landing page</a>. Eventually I will make a splash page for this site using the same technique. I'm excited to see how it turns out. In creating this unique ATAVATA page, however, I ran into some limitations of <a href="astrea.html">Astrea</a>. Because I had built the assembler to expect a standard input and to output pages with identical nav/body structure, making a unique page was impossible. I was disheartened at first, but then realized I had the power and ability to change Astrea to do whatever I want! It is mine after all. So I did. And after an hour of work I had a new version that works just as I want. I was so very happy with myself. This is exactly the kind of personal project I wanted, something that is mine to the core.

        For easter this year I woke up early to hide some eggs around the house for Ashley to find. I also got us little $15 toy digital cameras. They are surprisingly adept at taking crappy sub-megabyte photos. Perfect for the website.

        We watched the Sixers play. They took it down to the wire and won with a packed stadium present. Incredible energy.

        The project that had been asinged to me at work is finally coming together. All my efforts are finally being seen by the rest of the team and they are now able to add their own contributions. I feel very proud and immensely capable.

        I had a brief trip to California to visit family. I was pleased to be able to work remotely which allowed me to work east coast hours (6am to 2pm) and spend ample time outside in the California sun with myself and my family. I was lucky enough to be able to continue my <a href="running.html">running</a> and get some heavy miles in. The plane ride to and from were surprisingly not too terrible and I was able to burn through some more episodes of The Expanse. I finally finished <i>Words of Radiance</i> thank god. As I write this now a week later, I don't even remember how it ends. It wasn't a bad book, but golly was it far too long for me.

        I was promoted! Very happy to report that I have been hired full-time after my 6 month trial period. I am thankful for the job security and excited since I was finally getting involved with some more intense projects. I want my passion for my work to expand rapidly, and I think it will.
    </p>

        I discovered a wonderful website <a href="https://melonking.net">MelonKing.net</a>. I love its aesthetic and I want to create something like it. Badly. I read through Melon's guide to making a website and I was surprised at how much I already know. Turns out that fumbling one's way through making a site like this (let's me honest I've taken most of this from Devine (thanks Devine)) is enough to actually learn something. The concept of iFrames is interesting to me and I like how a website designed around them looks. I think I'll start there, trying to emulate something like <a href="https://cinni.net">cinni.net</a>. I ordered an HTML/CSS starter textbook, maybe web design is in my future? I'm giddy imagining people coming to slewis.wiki and seeing something inspiring.

        I started streaming! I wanted to see if my new desktop can handle gaming and running OBS, and shockingly it can with ease! I am streaming at either my youtube <a href="youtube.com/@atavata">@atavata</a> or on twitch <a href="twitch.tv/slewis_tv">slewis_tv</a>.

        Still reading <i>Words of Radiance</i>. Finally checked what percentage of the way through I was (I'm reading on Kindle) and was crushed to see I was barely over half way. Never again. I can't do these 1k+ page behemoths. I need the ebb and flow of book after book, at least two a month, not one every 3 months.

        Been playing some computer games with the bro. That's been fun. Mostly Helldivers 2 &mdash; <i>Starship Troopers</i> in videogame form.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hurt myself running. Very random injury, it happened on a 4.5 mile jog. Never felt any pain during the run or immediately after. But the next day and for almost a week after I could barely walk down stairs. Extremely tight/exhausted muscle in both legs between the bottom of my calf and top of my achilles. Unfortunate.

        The computer is built! I am very pleased with the result and I was proud of my ability to restrain myself from buying the shiniest and fastest components. The assembly of the computer itself was not nearly as difficult as I imagined it would be, it's just expensive legos but even more fool-proof. The most arduous leg of the desktop construction journey was installing Windows. I had bought a CD of the OS but of course did not have a CD drive. So I tried to bootload a USB with the data using my Mac and just could not get it to boot up. I ended up bricking two USB sticks and finally I gave in and bought an external CD drive. Despite that finally working, my machine had no Wifi drivers so Windows could not install as it requires an internet connection to download all of its "security" and "experiences" (i.e. spyware and ads). But, a few queries to ChatGPT on how to force open the command prompt during the Windows install allowed me to dive deep into the bowels of the file system and run the driver setup executable. Quite the experience. Now I have a $1300 World of Warcraft machine.

        I've begun my Spanish journey. I tried my hand at a game-ified language learning app Mango (similar to Duolingo) but I just get so bored so easily. Luckily I found Language Transfer which is a 90 episode conversation between a Spanish teacher and a student where all the conventions of "learning" go out the window. No memorization or quizes, just exposure. And I've learned a lot! The approach is to focus on the huge amount of overlap between English and Spanish &mdash; the fact that both are Latin derived languages and build from there. I've also started listening to a Spanish podcast No Hay Tos which is just two bros <i>güeyes</i> chatting. Normal conversation! Hard to follow but I am treating this immersively and am assuming that at some point it's all just going to click.

        I've gone to IffyBooks twice now, once to learn how to solder and again to learn how to pick locks. Fun, nerdy. Maybe I'll go back.
    </p>
    <p>
        And I am still running and reading. Pushing to get up to longer than 10 miles for my usual weekend runs and trying my damnedest to finish Words of Radiance.

        We began this year traveling back from a week-long trip to Maui. The time in the tropical sun was wonderful. We especially enjoyed snorkeling, swimming through the beautiful fish, and being out on the water with enormous humpback whales.
    </p>
    <p>
        Getting back into the fray, I spent significant time combing through this digital garden, cleaning up pages and refining Astrea. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This year I have several goals that I am particularly excited about:
        <ul>
            <li>Building a computer &mdash; I want to be able to play games regularly with my brother. My hope is this will be an effective (albeit expensive) framework for feeding my social circle.</li>
            <li>Attending <a href='https://iffybooks.net/'>Iffy Books</a> meetups &mdash; Iffy Books is a wonderfully nerdy shop in Philadelphia and I'm excited to get back into learning mini life skills like electronics, lockpicking, and first aid.</li>
            <li>Learn Spanish &mdash; In preparation for a trip to Mexico City.</li>
            <li>Run a half-marathon &mdash; I've signed up for an all-trail event to take place in the Wissahickon Valley.</li>
        </ul>
